                <h4>Game Setup: </h4>
                <p>The game board consists of a grid of face-down cards.
                Cards are arranged randomly on the board, with each card having an identical twin.</p>
                <h4>Card Matching:</h4>
                <p>Each turn, the player flips over two cards.
                    If the cards match, they remain face-up, and the player earns points.
                    If the cards do not match, they are turned face-down again, and the player's score is not affected.</p>
                <h4>Game Completion: </h4>
                <p>The game is won when all pairs of cards are successfully matched and face-up.
                    The game is lost when there more than three attemts to open the same card without finding a pair. 
                    Players strive to complete the game with the fewest moves and in the shortest time possible.</p>
                <h4>Tips for Success: </h4>
