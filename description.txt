Card Matching:

Each turn, the player flips over two cards.
If the cards match, they remain face-up, and the player earns points.
If the cards do not match, they are turned face-down again, and the player's score is not affected.

The game is won when all pairs of cards are successfully matched and face-up.
Players strive to complete the game with the fewest moves and in the shortest time possible.

Scoring:

Points are awarded for each successful card match.
Bonus points may be awarded for completing the game quickly or with minimal moves.


Tips for Success:

Create a mental map of the card pairs.
