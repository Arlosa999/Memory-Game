# Memory-Game
The goal of the game is to find matching pairs of cards on the game board. Each turn, flip over two cards. If they match, great! They stay face-up. If not, no worriesâ€”just remember where they are for your next turn. You have 3 trials to open the same card, if you missed to match that card, your game is over and you need to try again.
