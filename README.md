# Memory-Game
The goal of the game is to find matching pairs of cards on the game board. Each turn, flip over two cards. If they match, great! They stay face-up. If not, no worriesâ€”just remember where they are for your next turn. You have 3 trials to open the same card, if you missed to match that card, your game is over and you need to try again.

## Description
The Memory Game is my first attempt to create a front-end application. The intention of developing this game is is to demonstrate and practice javascript logic and connect it with HTML and style in CSS in a very condensed period.

I am an inspired entrepreneur and am learning code to find my company one day. Here is my first attempt to build a game to practice front-end development. I look for creative solutions to real-world problems and think of technical ways to address them. While no application is ever perfect, I find joy in the process and all my final products!
